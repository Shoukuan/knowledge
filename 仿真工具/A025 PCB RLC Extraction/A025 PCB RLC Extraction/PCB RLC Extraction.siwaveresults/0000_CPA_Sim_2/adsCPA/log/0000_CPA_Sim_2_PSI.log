  Number of cores = 4

  * Ref Net = GND
  * Global Die = IPD031-201_U2A5
  * Global VRM = XW_XW
  * Pin groups defined on XW_XW are used for extraction
 

  * Net = V1P0_S0 Sink Comp = XW_XW
  * CPA dB setup done.

 Package EM extraction in progress ...

  * AC Extraction in progress ...

     CG Extraction memory usage: 579.465 MB
     RL Extraction memory usage: 3004 MB

  * Passivity check in progress ...

     The network is found to be passive. No violations detected ...
 
 * Model extraction finished.

  * Loop RLCG results are presented using GND as return path.

  * Spice model export skipped due to insuffient network parameters.
  * Spice export requires either a pure DC network (Rdc/Ldc) or AC network (Rdc, Lac and CG) parameters
  * IBIS model generation skipped, as it requires Rdc, Lac and CG parameters. 

     Peak memory usage: 3583.46 MB.

  * SPEF model generation is skipped, as it needed both Rdc and CG to be extracted!
